Hey there, I am Vikas Gupta. I am a security researcher, mostly working on mobile security lately. In the past, I have worked on network security as well. Lately, I have been working on pentesting Android and iOS application, and evaluating security of Android OS. If you want to know more about my professional skills, visit my LinkedIn  and Github profiles.

This blog acts as a public notebook for me and I believe in [Do things, tell people.](http://mdswanson.com/blog/2013/08/11/write-things-tell-people.html)

I also take up freelance pentesting projects. In case you have an assignment for me, feel free to reach me at: vikasgupta(dot)nit(at)gmail(dot)com.
