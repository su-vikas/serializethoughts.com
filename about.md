Hey there, I am Vikas Gupta. I am a security researcher, with interest in all aspects of security. Lately I have been working  on mobile application security, doing both offense and defense related projects. I am [co-author](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x02-Frontispiece.md#vikas-gupta) of OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG). 

I also enjoy reverse engineering obfuscated programs - using combination of techniques involving symbolic execution, emulators and manual analysis. In past I have worked on varied security projects including network security, web application security, and operating systems security. 

If you want to know more about my professional skills, visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikas-gupta-8462a415/) and [Github](https://github.com/su-vikas).

This blog acts as a public notebook for me. Many ideas discussed over here might not be ground breaking or new, but to have these ideas documented in one place helps me and hopfully many others around the web to keep learning. I have been benefitted a lot in the past with such blog posts and this is my effort to give something back to the community. Also, I believe in the idea of [Do things, tell people.](http://mdswanson.com/blog/2013/08/11/write-things-tell-people.html)

I also take up **freelance pentesting/reverse engineering projects and organise customized mobile application security trainings**. In case you have an assignment for me, feel free to reach me at: *vikig(at)protonmail(dot)com*.
