Hi! I am a security researcher, specialising in mobile application security and obfuscation. I am involved in both offense and defense aspects of mobile application security. I am also [co-author](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x02-Frontispiece.md#vikas-gupta) of [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)]("https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/"). I enjoy reverse engineering, especially obfuscated programs, and I am well acquainted with various reverse engineering techniques including symbolic execution, emulation etc. In the past I have worked on various security related projects including network security, web application security, and operating systems security.

I also take up **freelance pentesting/reverse engineering projects and organise customized mobile application security trainings**. In case you have an assignment for me, feel free to reach me at: [vikig@protonmail.com]("mailto:vikig@protonmail.com").
